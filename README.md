# SimpleXML

http://simple.sourceforge.net

Simple is a high performance XML serialization and configuration framework for Java. Its goal is to provide an XML framework that enables rapid development of XML configuration and communication systems. This framework aids the development of XML systems with minimal effort and reduced errors. It offers full object serialization and deserialization, maintaining each reference encountered. In essence it is similar to C# XML serialization for the Java platform, but offers additional features for interception and manipulation. 

## Feedback

*I tried this framework and it's awesome on Android.*

*BTW your API is ten times better than the serialization framework in .NET and probably one of the best designed frameworks I’ve seen.*

*Just thought I should mention, my team is using Simple to deserialize our Autonomous Underwater Vehicle’s configuration. ARISE AUV Team Captain.*

*I think Simple framework was an excelent idea. For some years now I have been trying to find such an easy way to work with XML in Java, and finally, here it is.*

*I just wanted to say thanks to the Simple team, you guys have done an awsome job with Simple, its very intuitive and very powerfull, the combination of which has saved me massive amounts of time on this project!*

*Simple is a great product. I’d been working with Java bean serialization and the XML it generates sucks really hard!! Not to mention needing to expose all kinds of private state with getter/setter pairs. Keep up the good work. Our dev team really appreciates your efforts.*

*Wonderful project you have got there.*

*I really like the annotation approach to doing this as it's quick and easy to understand. The tutorial was also excellent as I could actually start coding in <5 minutes, bit of a novelty after spending an hour poring over JAXB APIs.*

*Nice work! Simple has greatly helped my projects both at work and at home!*

*I just found Simple today. Excellent work on the project. Nice, simple, small. I usually work in C#, so Simple's syntax is very comfortable to me compared to .NET's attribute driven mark-up.*

*I've been looking for a fast lightweight java xml serializer for a few days, just came across Simple, it looks great. I especially like the compact xml it can produce, since I'm going to be using it for string message passing across a network.*

*First let me say that simple looks great - it's refreshing to find a java serialization tool that works without 5 megs of dependencies!*

*I discovered Simple XML and I think it's great. I like the concept of source-first much better than JAXB's schema-first.*

*First of all thanks ... it's so simple! so simple that when I hit something, I can't help myself from thinking I've misread the doc.*

*I love to use the Simple XML Framework, it makes things so much easier for me.*

*I found your Simple XML serialization framework. It's a great software. It saved me a lot of work.*

*I found SimpleXML library just recently and it is great. Saved me a lot of time.*

*I found your Simple XML serialization framework and it is great piece of software.*

## Features

### Simple framework with powerful capabilities
The framework used to provide XML serialization is simple to use and revolves around several annotations an a single persister object used to read and write objects to and from XML. 

### Can handle cycles in the object graph
The persistence engine can handle cycles in the object graph, which enables complex objects with recursive references to be serialized. This ensures that the deserialization process can recover all object references. 

### It requires absolutely no configuration
Unlike many of the XML frameworks for Java there are no mappings or configuration required to serialize objects regardless of its complexity. The XML schema is represented using field annotations. 

### Extremely rapid development with XML
Developing XML configuration and communication systems can be done much quicker than through the use of XML frameworks such as DOM, SAX, and even other frameworks such as Digester and XStream. 

### Converts to and from human editable XML
A primary goal for the framework is that the XML data used to deserialize a serialize objects is human readable. All XML elements and attributes take a simple structure that can be easily created with a text editor. 

### Contains an XML templating system
As part of the deserialization process template markers within the XML elements and attributes can be replaced with variables. This allows the system to be easily adapted for use as a configuration system with dynamic value substitution.
